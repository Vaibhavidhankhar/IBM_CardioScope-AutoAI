# 💖 CardioScope AI - Heart Risk Predictor

🌌 **Welcome to CardioScope AI**, an intelligent, galaxy-themed web tool that predicts the **risk of heart attack**. Tool is designed using IBM Watson AutoAI data science, health analytics and deployed as an interactive web application. This project uses health-related data to analyze and predict the risk of a heart attack using an AutoML pipeline.
